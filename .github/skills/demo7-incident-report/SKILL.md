## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What Went Well ✅
1. AI Agent enabled rapid problem diagnosis
2. Cross-system integrated queries were highly efficient
3. Automated bug fix saved significant time
4. Immediate post-fix verification of effectiveness

### Areas for Improvement ⚠️
1. Sync service lacked proper monitoring alerts
2. Problem discovery took too long (6 days)
3. External logistics risks not included in early warning system

### Improvement Recommendations 💡
1. Set up automatic alerts when sync success rate drops below 95%
2. Implement AIOps anomaly detection
3. Integrate weather/logistics APIs for risk early warning
